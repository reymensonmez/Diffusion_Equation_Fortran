# Steady-State 2D Diffusion Solver in Fortran 90

This project implements a numerical solution to the steady-state 2D diffusion equation (with zero source term) using the **Gauss-Seidel iterative method** in Fortran 90.

## 📌 Equation Solved

We solve the steady-state 2D diffusion equation:

\[
\frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial y^2} = 0
\]

This is mathematically equivalent to Laplace's equation for cases with constant diffusivity and no internal source.

## 🚀 Method

The code uses:
- A **finite difference** discretization , central difference.
- A **uniform Cartesian grid**
- The **Gauss-Seidel method** for faster convergence 

## 🧱 Grid and Boundary Conditions

- Grid size: 51 × 51 points
- Domain: [0, 1] × [0, 1]
- Spacing: uniform in both `x` and `y`
- Boundary conditions:
  - Bottom boundary (y = 0): \( T = 1 \)
  - Other boundaries: \( T = 0 \)
